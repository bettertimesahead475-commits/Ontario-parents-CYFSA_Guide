  <h2>5 Facebook Post Templates (Ontario CYFSA educational only)</h2>
  <p><strong>Rule:</strong> Do not promise outcomes. Do not give legal advice. Always include “Educational only”.</p>

  <h3>Post 1 — Launch</h3>
  <p>Ontario parents dealing with CAS/CYFSA: I built a small EDUCATIONAL resource to help with process + evidence literacy (NOT legal advice). Verified lawyer resources (LAO/LSO/LSRS) + worksheets. Link: [your site]</p>

  <h3>Post 2 — Evidence literacy</h3>
  <p>If you’re in a CYFSA file, your documentation matters. I’m building an EDUCATIONAL analyzer that flags common evidence issues (hearsay wording, missing dates, missing attachments). Not legal advice. Link: [your site]</p>

  <h3>Post 3 — Legal Aid</h3>
  <p>Need a lawyer? Start with Legal Aid Ontario (LAO) + verify any lawyer in the Law Society of Ontario directory. EDUCATIONAL post only. Links on my site: [your site]</p>

  <h3>Post 4 — Subscriber toolkit</h3>
  <p>New: Parent toolkit downloads (timeline worksheet, disclosure checklist). EDUCATIONAL only. Not legal advice. Link: [your site]</p>

  <h3>Post 5 — Call for lawyers</h3>
  <p>Ontario child protection lawyers: I’m building a consent-based referral pipeline (educational intake summaries only). If interested, DM me with your LSO directory link + cities served. [your site]</p>
