  <h2>Lawyer Outreach — CYFSA Educational Platform (Ontario)</h2>
  <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Referral partnership: Ontario CYFSA educational platform (consent-based leads)</p>

  <p>Hi [Lawyer / Firm Name],</p>

  <p>I run a small Ontario-only educational platform for parents dealing with CYFSA. It focuses on procedural literacy and evidence-quality flags (educational only; not legal advice). Parents can opt-in to share a short educational summary with a lawyer after explicit, timestamped consent.</p>

  <p><strong>What you get:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Ontario-based leads by city/region</li>
    <li>Basic educational intake summary (not legal advice)</li>
    <li>Only sent after explicit consent</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>What we do NOT do:</strong> no guarantees, no outcome predictions, no legal advice, no sharing without consent.</p>

  <p>If you’re open to it, reply with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cities served</li>
    <li>Whether you accept Legal Aid certificates (if applicable)</li>
    <li>Preferred intake method (phone / email / form link)</li>
    <li>Verification: your LSO directory listing link</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks,<br>
  Mr. Pelkie<br>
